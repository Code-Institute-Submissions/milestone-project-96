# Fray + Anchor

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

![Fray + Anchor responsive website mockup](https://github.com/chloelewisdev/milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/mockupscreenshot.png)

Fray + Anchor is a fictional company which provides online macrame classes. The idea came to me whilst working on my own macrame projects, as I have often thought it would be great to be able to ask a teacher about a specific technique or to be guided through a project whilst at home, rather than using YouTube videos or PDF patterns. I thought this service would be useful to others too in the same position, who want to take up macrame as a hobby but don’t have the time to teach themselves and aren’t able to make a class in person. 

This project is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute, and the main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of 3 pages using HTML5 and CSS3.

## **User Experience**
This section provides insight into the UX process, focusing on who the Fray + Anchor website is for, the main aims of the project and how the website can help users meet their needs.  

### Project goals:
* To get people to enquire about upcoming macrame classes
* To learn about the benefits of learning and making macrame as a hobby
* To be able to easily contact Fray + Anchor with any questions
* To present information about the online macrame classes so that people understand easily what is available – times, price and what is included 
* To create a website that is visually appealing, and fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes 
* To make Fray + Anchor seem a reputable class provider, by creating a professional website

### User Stories

**New users:** 
* I am a user who is new to macrame - I need to be convinced why I should invest my time and money into this craft, and I also want to learn what is involved in a class – the price, the time and the result.  If I decide I am interested I want to be able to easily enquire on the website about an upcoming class. 
* I am a user who has learned some macrame previously but I am now ready to take on a more difficult project and want a teacher to guide me through this online as I am unable to attend any classes in person – I want to view the classes available and find one suited to my level. I want to make sure that a teacher would be available to help me with more advanced techniques. 
* I want to take an online macrame class, but I want to do a different project to the ones advertised on the website. I want to be able to contact the company to find out if they would consider teaching a different project and how much this would be. 

**Returning user:**
* I am a returning user who has already done one online Fray + Anchor macrame class, I loved it and want my work to feature on the image gallery. I therefore want to visit the site to learn what I need to do to feature on the image gallery on the website. I am also considering doing another class because I loved the first one so much, I want to view the classes available along with their suitability levels, and also learn if there is any discount for returning students. 

**Business Owner:**
* I am one of the owners of the business and want to see the company succeed. I want to clearly display information about upcoming classes in an attractive and informative way, and I want visitors to be able to easily able to enquire and contact the company easily. 


### Strategy plane: 
The main goal of the website is to attract users to enquire about an upcoming online macrame class. The website is aimed at a Business to Consumer creative audience. It should include minimal content and lots of imagery.  I started the UX process by creating the User Stories above which helped me work out who the project was aimed at and what I would need to include in the website to satisfy the needs of the users. 

### Scope plane:
The key features of the website were developed based on user needs. Users should be able to do the following on the website:

* Find out information about upcoming classes, including dates, times, content and price
* Enquire about an upcoming class
* Learn about the benefits of macrame 
* View the work of other students that have completed a class
* Learn how to submit completed class work to feature on the website’s gallery
* Contact the company with a question
* Visit social media channels
* Learn more about the company 

### Structure plane:

At this point I began to think about the information architecture and the different interactions that could take place across the site. I grouped the features into four main pages: ‘Home’, ‘Classes’, ‘Gallery’ and ‘Contact’ and thought about the navigation through the website and how the user could move across the pages. I knew I wanted to make it easy for users to go from the homepage to the Classes page, as the main aim of the project is to gain enquiries about upcoming classes. Therefore I started to order the content with this in mind.  

I wanted the pages to have some consistency, so thought about the homepage banner image, and how the following pages would also start with a header image, which would be shorter than the homepage banner image but following the same pattern. I decided that there should be some space under these starting images for some ‘content hinting’ underneath the starting images - I didn’t want the image to cover the full screen (across all devices). 

Once a form was completed, I knew I wanted to provide some kind of message to the user that this had been submitted. As I haven’t yet learned JavaScript I started to look into Bootstrap ‘modal’ messages after my mentor recommended this to me, and I looked into how this could work.  

I wanted to make sure the nav bar was always easy to view in order to help users navigate through the site, therefore I thought about creating a fixed nav, and also I researched the ‘Hamburger icon’ which would enable viewers to easily move around the pages at all times when on a smaller device. 

### Skeleton plane:

I was at this stage ready to put together wireframes. I used Figma for these, creating wireframes for each page on desktop, tablet and mobile. 

I aimed to make sure the main content areas were expressed in similar ways, to create consistency. I also knew I wanted the CTA buttons to stand out and have a consistent design. 

I decided that the user would be presented with simple choices on each page – namely: **Home** – view classes or view gallery, on the **Classes** page – submit an enquiry, on the **Gallery** page – send an email, on the **Contact** page – send a message on the contact form. 
 
Because there will be quite a lot of imagery on the pages, I decided whilst doing the wireframes that there needed to be plenty of space on each page to avoid the pages feeling cluttered, leaving the user overwhelmed. 

Whilst doing the wireframes, I also considered whether to include the ‘Image Gallery’ on the homepage. I knew I wanted the user to firstly consider visiting the upcoming classes, so this needed to appear as the first action on the homepage, however I decided the image gallery could actually persuade and encourage the user to view the upcoming classes too, so although this is secondary to the classes page, it is still important and I therefore decided to include this. 

The wireframes can be viewed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ymDA1MVFFoQ4qH9hqnQnIj/Chloe-Lewis-Milestone-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1)

### Surface plane: 

I next moved on to the design work. 

**Colours:** Macrame is currently popular in fashion and interiors, therefore I knew I wanted the website to feel modern rather than having an ‘arts and crafts’ feel. I decided to use cool greys (#f2f0f1) and a light shade of pink (#FECCC2) as the predominant colours with white, black and dark grey accents in order to achieve this. 

**Fonts:** I used Google Fonts to select the fonts for my project. I wanted to find two fonts that worked well together – one for the logo and headings, and another for the body text. Overall I wanted the design to look modern, whilst also related to the craft of macrame. For the logo and headings, I decided to use Delius Swash Caps as I thought the cursive nature of this font could be related to macrame cord. I then used Open Sans for the body text which I thought complimented Delius Swash Caps.

**Images:** I had a lot of my own images from my own macrame projects so I decided to use these for the website, however I did use a stock image for the ‘Gallery’ pager header image. I took this from [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) and the information for this image can be found below in the Credits section.

**Layout:** I decided to use different background colours to signal to the user different areas of content. I wanted the light pink colour to be prominent and so used this on the fixed nav and footer on all pages. I decided to use grey and white background colours to separate out the content on each page. I decided to keep this consistent with each page. I thought the white and light grey helped to keep a feeling of space on each page too, allowing the images and text to stand out. I decided to give all buttons a dark grey shade with white text on all pages to help them stand out. The layout uses a lot of boxes, with straight edges used across the site.


## Features
The project consists of four different pages, all of which can be accessed through the menu in the nav bar. 

**Consistent features across all pages:**

-	The fixed nav containing the menu at the top of the page is consistentand across all pages.
-   The sticky footer is consistent across all pages.
-	There is a header image with overlaying title text on all pages.
-	The buttons used across the site are all the same colour and style.

**Home:** 

* Feature ‘Benefits of learning macrame’ – this feature is to promote the positive reasons to learn macrame to new users, and to reaffirm the benefits to returning users. 
* Feature ‘Upcoming Classes’ – three image cards with a description underneath displaying a selection of upcoming classes, with a button to click through to view ‘All classes’. This feature is to inform new and returning users about some of the projects available, creating interest in viewing more information about the classes. 
* Feature ‘Image Gallery’ – three images displaying work by past students. This feature is there to convince new users that the company is credible and trustworthy by showing real outcomes from real-life clients. The images are followed by a button 'View All' which takes users to the Gallery page where they can see even more real-life examples of work created by Fray + Anchor students. 
* Feature ‘Scroll to top’ button – this feature enables the user to quickly move back to the top of the page, rather than having to scroll back up, improving the user experience especially on smaller screens. 

**Classes:**

* ‘Intro text’ feature – simple text for both new and returning users, introduces the user to the page whilst also providing some overview information applicable to all classes - materials needed, a bit about the teacher, class size. It includes information about a discount for returning students. Presenting this information straight away means users won’t be thinking about these questions whilst viewing the classes, and can concentrate on the class information. Within this section is an enquiry button which users can click on to jump straight down to the enquiry form at the bottom of the page. I decided to add this feature at the top rather than adding an enquiry button to each class as I thought this would be too cluttered. This way, users viewing the different classes are never far away from being able to make an enquiry, either whilst closer to the top of the page or closer to the bottom of the page. 
* Classes feature – this is for new and returning users - there are 4 classes advertised with an image and text describing what the project is, price, when, how long it will take and suitability levels. 
* Feature ‘Enquire Today’ – this form enables new and returning students to easily enquire about an upcoming class. Users can select the class they would like to enquire about from a dropdown within the form. The labels for the form are positioned above the input fields, so that the label text doesn’t disappear when the user begins to submit some information, creating a better user experience.  
When the user completes the form, there is a modal that pops up with a ‘Thank you message’. 
* Feature ‘Scroll to top’ button - this feature enables the user to quickly move back to the top of the page, rather than having to scroll back up improving the user experience especially on smaller screens. 

**Gallery:**
* 'Intro text' feature – this short introductory text section explains that the images show work completed by by Fray + Anchor students. This text is for new and returning users - for new users it helps reaffirm the credibiily of the classes, and for returning students there is an e-mail link which can be clicked on if they wish to submit an image of their own work to be featured on the website’s gallery. 
* 'Image gallery' feature - There are 12 images, 4 on 3 rows, and each image is displayed on an image card, with a short description underneath explaining who did the work and where they are from. This feature is for new users as the image gallery provides visual evidence of the outcomes of the macrame classes, and it is also for returning users who may gain a sense of pride seeing their own work displayed on the website. 

**Contact:**
 
* 'Intro text' feature – this is a text section encouraging new and old students to get in touch with any questions, general enquiries and specific enquiries about possible projects by completing the form further down the page. 
* Feature 'Contact form' – The labels for the form are positioned above the input fields, so that the label doesn’t disappear when the user begins to submit some information.  When the user completes the form, there is a modal that pops up with a ‘Thank you message’. 

*Note - There is no ‘scroll to top’ button on this page as it is much shorter than the other pages.*

### Features to consider implementing in the future:

-	For the Gallery page, it could be good to have a simple form where students can upload an image of their work as an attachment within the form, rather than having to send as an attachment in an email. 
-	It would be good user experience if a 'Classes' button was added to the Gallery page, so that the user can easily move to the Classes page without having to go to the menu at the top, and possibly for there to be a button to the Image Gallery at the bottom of the Classes page too for the same reason. 
-   It would be great for credibility if testimonials could also be added across the website. 
-	A short video showing some basic knots could be useful to a new user, giving them a free taste of macrame to see if they enjoy it. Or a small form where the user submits their e-mail address and are then sent an e-mail containing a video with a basic knot tutorial for free - this would be a useful way to expand the customer database.  
-	An online booking or payment system for the classes would be very useful.
-	The site could benefit from images of people enjoying making macrame – at the moment there are no faces and so the website lacks emotion.  This would be particularly relevant for the ‘Benefits of learning macrame’ section on the homepage.
-	It might be reassuring for the user to learn more about the teacher – possibly a feature with an image of the teacher and a short description about their background would be beneficial on the ‘Upcoming Classes’ page. 
-	It would be good if there was an option to sign up to a newsletter, which would help create a larger user database for future marketing.

## Testing:

### Testing User Stories:

* New user - *new to macrame and needs to be convinced about the benefits and whether to invest time and money into the craft* - on the homepage, the user is presented with the benefits of learning macrame. On this page the user can also see some real-life outcomes of taking a class (images of work by other students), as well as a selection of upcoming classes. On the Classes page, the user can view the price, time and suitability levels for each class, and can easily submit an enquiry about a class on this page. If this user needs further convincing about taking a class, they can continue navigating down the menu items to the Gallery page, where they can view more real-life examples of work by students who have taken a Fray + Anchor class, and they can also make contact bby sending a message on the 'Contact' page, or by visiting the information in the footer. 

* New user - *new user who has learned some macrame previously but now wants to take on a more difficult project and wants a teacher to guide them through this online* - this user can easily navigate to the Classes page from the homepage or from the menu at the top. On the Classes page, the user can view the different levels of suitability for each class, so they can view 'Intermediate' or 'Advanced' classes. They can also view more information about the teacher in the intro section of the Class page, and understand the support provided in each class. This user can easily enquire by submitting the form on this page, or they can also make contact by submitting the form on the Contact page or clicking on the e-mail link in the footer. 

* New user - *I want to take an online macrame class, but I want to do a different project to the ones advertised on the website* - this user can view the list of upcoming classes on the Classes page, and if they want to make an enquiry on this page they could select 'Other' from the dropdown in the Enquiry form, or they could visit the Contact page and send a message on the Contact form here. Enquiries about projects other than those already advertised are welcomed in the intro text on the Contact page. 

* Returning user - *I am a returning user, and want to submit an image of my work to be displayed on the Fray + Anchor image gallery. I also want to see if there are any discounts if I take another class.* - This user can visit the Gallery page, and easily find an email link which enables them to easily send an email with an image attachment to Fray + Anchor. If the user decides to look at taking another class, they can see straight away in the intro text on the Classes page, that there is a discount for returning students.

* Business owner - *I want to see an attractive, informative website which enables users to easily enquire or contact the company* The owner would see that there is a consistent design across the website, with lots of imagery making the site attractive to a creative audience. Information about upcoming classes is clearly displayed, and customers can easily enquire or make contact with the company on the Classes page or on the Contact page. 

### Validating the code:

**HTML** I validated the HTML with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

**CSS** I validated the CSS with the [W3 CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Testing on different browsers:
I manually tested the website on the following browsers:
* Chrome
* Safari
* Mozilla Firefox

### Testing responsiveness on multiple devices and screen sizes:

I manually tested the website by using Google Developer Tools to check each individual page and the website as a whole worked on different devices and different screen sizes, including: Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5 SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro. I also manually tested the site on my MacBook Air, iPad, and iPhone 11. 

### Issues found
* The Gallery page had four images per row for small screen sizes and upwards initially. By looking at the Google Developer Tools I could see this looked very overcrowded on iPad. Therefore I updated this to have 3 images per row for small screens, and 4 images per row for medium screens and upwards. I fixed this by hiding the fourth image on each row for small screens.  

* I initially used Bootstrap modal messages for the enquiry form and the contact form. However, this meant the user could submit the form, without completing the required fields. The form would require JavaScript to enable a message to appear correctly upon submission only when the required fields have been completed, therefore I decided to remove the modal messages. This is something that could be developed in the next stage of the website. 

* I used https://favicon.io/ to generate a favicon for the project. I initially added the favicon to the 'images' folder however this didn't work. I looked at the Code Institute's Slack Community to see if anyone else had had this problem, and saw that the Favicon folder needed to be moved into the main directory. Once I did this, the favicon worked correctly. 

* On smaller screens, there was a strip of white space appearing on the right of the screen. Upon inspection, I realised that there was a margin left and right of "-15px" in the footer, once I cleared these by setting the row class to zero the problem was resolved.
